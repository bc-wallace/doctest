        I am a weather enthusiast with a strong interest in big data and efficiency. Originally from Chicago, Illinois, I grew up with a fascination towards tornadoes and severe weather in general. I received my B.Sc in Meteorology with a concentration in Geographic Information Systems from Western Illinois University. I later moved to Albany, New York to attend graduate school at the University at Albany where I received my M.S and PhD in Atmospheric Science in 2019 and 2022 respectively.

        Outside work, I enjoy hiking, board games, traveling, and archiving old media.
